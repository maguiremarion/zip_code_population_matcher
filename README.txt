When given one csv file of random zip codes and one csv file of zip codes with their populations, this program places the populations in the column next to the random zips

You will need 3 csv files for this to work:
• One that has randomized zip codes in the 1st column called 'givenZips.csv'
• One that has every US zip code in the 1st column and their population in the 2nd column called 'zipAndPop.csv' (2016 info obtainable on census.gov or also in this repository)
• One that is an exact copy of 'givenZips' called 'givenZipsO.csv' to be used as the output file

Run the program with all these csv files in the same directory and 'givenZipsO.csv' will be the final output file you're looking for!
